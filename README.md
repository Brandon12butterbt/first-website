# AFluxGen Web App

This is a personal full-stack web application project built using **Angular** for the frontend and **Node.js (Express)** for the backend API. It is hosted on an **AWS EC2 instance** with static files served through **Nginx** and protected and cached via **AWS CloudFront**. Domain resolution is managed through **Route 53**.
